At Umbrel, we believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the convenience and benefits of the cloud, without giving up ownership and control of their data.
</p>

<p align="center">
To achieve our vision, we're building a new kind of a home server OS. Instead of paying ransoms for storing your data on someone else's computer while they auction it off to advertisers — you can now easily spin up a server and self-host your data and services at home.
</p>

<p align="center">
Just like the cloud, but one that you own and control.

## Installing umbrelOS

umbrelOS is designed for the [Umbrel Home](https://umbrel.com/umbrel-home), where it includes first-class support for all features. On other devices (like Raspberry Pi or x86 systems), it’s freely available with core functionality, but support and feature availability are best-effort due to hardware differences.

For a detailed feature breakdown, see our [comparison guide](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/wiki/umbrelOS-on-Umbrel-Home-vs.-DIY).
